MLDS Final Experiment 
====
Machine Learning and having it deep and structured final project experiments' source code.


## Environment
python3 <br />
tensorflow 1.0 <br />
scipy <br />

## Experiments

- LSTM forget gate bias setting: adding-lstm_bias/ <br />
- Identity Recurrent Neural Network exp1 - adding problem: adding/ <br />

## Data

- LSTM forget gate bias: <br />
  Source code will autogenerate a random training and testing data.
- Identity Recurrent Neural Network exp1 - adding problem: <br />
  Use TensorFlow package to import the MNIST dataset.


## Usage 
1. Go to the experiment folder that you want to test.
2. Start training !

## Train
cd to the experiment folder
```
$ python3 main.py 
```

## Model
- dcgan structure
- use one hot encoding for condition tags

## Experiment Results
